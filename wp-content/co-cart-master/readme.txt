## Testimonials - Developers love it

#### Credits

This plugin is created by [Sébastien Dumont](https://sebastiendumont.com/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress v5.4
* WooCommerce v4.3
* PHP v7.3

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoCart free? =

Yes! CoCart’s core features are absolutely free. [CoCart Pro completes the full cart experience!](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce v4.3 or higher installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation.

= Why should I use CoCart? =

The question is why not! WooCommerce's REST API is only created for controlling the backend of your store. It does not nativley provide an API for controlling the frontend.

CoCart handles your customers cart for you ready to use in any modern framework of your choosing. No local storing required. It's **Powerful** and **Developer** friendly ready to build your headless store the way you want, **without the need to build an API**.

If you are wanting to build a headless store powered by WooCommerce, then CoCart is your solution. But don't take my word for it. [Checkout the testimonials left by others](https://cocart.xyz/wall-of-love/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

With [the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) provided, you’ll see how to add products to a cart and allow your customers to manage it in no time at all.

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for store owners and developers. If you want to create an e-commerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API, then CoCart is for you.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin is built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it. [Checkout the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) to get some understanding.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation for CoCart on the [CoCart REST API Docs](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

= Can I change the layout format/add/change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. Filters are available to do just that. [Checkout the tweaks plugin](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart-tweaks) to view or maybe use the examples provided. [View the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) for more.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler in the first place? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler does not support guest customers.
- The default session handler does not store additional data that maybe required to help you.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session table in the database? =

The default WooCommerce session table only stores the basics of a cart in session. CoCart provides additional data that maybe required to help you and other add-ons/extensions developed by CoCart or third-parties.

Such as when the cart was created. This information is only stored in the browser session.

Also the source of the cart it was last saved. For the web it will be `WooCommerce` and for your headlesss store `CoCart`. This lets you know which version of your store your customers are shopping from.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless store on another domain? =

Yes of course. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can [manually enable it via the filters in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

=  Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

Not at this time. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignore any REST API from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar. Code has been contributed to the plugin that will allow third-party plugins enable this ability and awaiting feedback.

However, TaxJar for WooCommerce plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "TaxJar for WooCommerce" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Why CoCart and not WooCommerce Store API? =

WooCommerce Store API is limited and designed mainly to focus on their [Gutenberg blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/) they have developed in React. CoCart is designed to focus on decoupling WooCommerce so you can use any framework to allow your store to be headless.

= Do you have a JavaScript Library? =

Yes we do. You can [find it here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cocart/cocart-rest-api). It doesn't require authentication for guest customers. It supports CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript Modules (ESM). Requests are made with [Axios library](https://github.com/axios/axios) with [support to promises](https://github.com/axios/axios#promises).

= Can I install/update CoCart via Composer? =

Yes. The best method would be to install/update CoCart from the GitHub repository but you can also do so via [https://wpackagist.org/](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce&type=plugin)

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it via the network and all sites will have CoCart enabled.

= Can I enable white labelling for CoCart? =

Yes you can. You will have to edit your `wp-config.php` file to add a new constant. [Details can be found in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#wp-config-php-white-labelling).

= Does CoCart work with the Dokan plugin? =

Yes. The only feature you wont be able to use are coupons if you have [CoCart Pro](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart). This is because Dokan disables the use of coupons in WooCommerce. All other features are compatible.

= Where can I report bugs? =

Report bugs on the [CoCart GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues). You can also notify us via the support forum – be sure to search the forums to confirm that the error has not already been reported.

= CoCart is awesome! Can I contribute? =

Yes, you can! Join in on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the [development blog](https://cocart.xyz/news/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) to stay up-to-date with everything happening in the project.

= Is CoCart translatable? =

Yes! CoCart is deployed with full translation and localization support via the ‘cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce’ text-domain.

= Where can I get help or talk other users about CoCart core? =

If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the [CoCart support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/) or [join the CoCart Community on Slack](https://cocart.xyz/community/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) where you will find like minded developers who help each other out.
